0th layer is the input layer

al are the activation parameters of layer l

dl are the error parameters of layer l used to calculate the derivatives
    d0 is not needed
    

A single data input vector needs the numpy shape (lenght,1), i.e. it 
    has to be a column vector. This ensures the correctness of the
    matrix products and outer products within the program

In this implementation the bias term has no error node, because a is set to
    1 by hand. The theta values are updated nevertheless, because of the
    outer product of aj and di to get the derivatives of the cost function.
